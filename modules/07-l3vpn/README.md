# Module 7 — MPLS L3VPN Services

This module focuses on the service-provider problem space around l3vpn. It connects design intent to operations so you can make defensible architecture choices and troubleshoot production-impacting issues with confidence.

## Prerequisites
- Modules 3–4 (MP-BGP and MPLS labels).
- Recommended: complete [Module 6 — Segment Routing](../06-sr/README.md) first.

## What you'll be able to do
- explain why this technology is used in SP networks
- map control-plane signals to forwarding outcomes
- verify healthy operation using platform show commands
- identify common failure patterns and likely root causes

## Key protocols/technologies covered
- BGP, L3VPN, MP-BGP, MPLS

## Labs
- See [`../../labs`](../../labs) for available lab guides tied to this module.
